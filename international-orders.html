                <p><strong>How will I know the total cost of my order?</strong><br>

If the country is not available to prepay duties and taxes during checkout, your order will be shipped DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid). You will be liable for all duties, customs, and sales taxes based on the country requirements where the order is being sent. Upon arrival, a separate payment will be required to release your order. Opening Ceremony is not responsible for payment of this duty. Please consult your local customs office for more information.</p>

                In the instance that the prepay duties and tax option is not available to the Ship-To address/country that you entered, you will be liable for all duties, customs and sales taxes based on the country requirements where the order is being sent. Upon arrival, a separate payment will be required to release your order. Opening Ceremony is not responsible for payment of this duty.

                <p><strong>How much does international shipping cost?</strong><br>
                International shipping is calculated based on multiple factors, including the destination country, desired shipping speed, number of items purchased, and total weight of the items. International shipping will be calculated during the Borderfree international checkout process.</p>

                <p><strong>How much duty and taxes are charged on international orders?</strong><br>
                Duties (or Customs tariffs) are set by the destination country’s Customs and Revenues authorities. The total duties are calculated based on a combination of factors, including the country of origin in terms of where the goods were manufactured and the classification of that merchandise as defined by a harmonized system adopted by the countries that Borderfree supports. International taxes (such as Value Added Tax, or VAT) are set by the destination country. You will be able to view the guaranteed total amount of applicable duty and tax/VAT for your order within the Borderfree international checkout process if your Ship To country allows for the DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) option. </p>

                <p>However, if the prepay duties and tax option is not available based on the Ship To address/country that you entered, you will be liable for all duties, customs and sales taxes based on the country requirements where the order is being sent. Upon arrival, a separate payment will be required to release your order. Opening Ceremony is not responsible for payment of this duty. Please contact your local customs office for more information.</p>

                <p><strong>Are there any restrictions on items that can be shipped to my country?</strong><br>

                <p>Most items arrive 11 to 24 business days after receipt of your order depending on your Ship To address. Shipping windows are estimates and delivery dates cannot be guaranteed. </p>

                <p>Occasionally, a single order needs to be sent in two or more shipments. Shipping charges apply only to the first package shipped. There are no additional shipping charges for subsequent shipments for the same order.</p>

                <p><strong>What will my credit card statement say?</strong><br>
