        <h2>International Orders</h2>
        <p><strong>Can my order be delivered internationally?</strong><br>
            Yes, it can! Just select your shipping country, start shopping, and the price of shipping will appear at checkout. <br>
            Please remember we can't control any import duties and taxes you may have to pay upon the arrival of your order in your country. </p>

            <p>If you would like assistance with an international order, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and we'll get back to you ASAP. Thank you!</p>

            <p><strong>What is the status of my international order?</strong><br>
            Post-purchase you will receive an email with a link to track your order.</p>

            <p><strong>What is the return policy for international orders?</strong><br>
            If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase please contact us via email and we will provide you with further instructions on how to request a return. </p>

            <p>We are unable to provide free returns for international orders at this time. Any return shipping charges will be deducted from the refund. </p>

            <p>Please note, you have 14 days from delivery date to return your product. Any already worn products will not be accepted. Damages made after you received your order are not a valid reason to return it. Please feel free to email us with any questions.</p>

            <p><strong>Estimated Timeframe for Returns:</strong><br>
            Typically international returns can take up to 14 business days from the date you return your package to be delivered to us. Once we receive your return, we will process your refund within 1 to 5 business days.</p>

            <p>For any returns from within the European Union, the wait is typically shorter.</p>

            <p>In any case, you will receive an email from us with information.</p>

            <p><strong>How do I initiate a return for my order?</strong><br>
            To request a return for your internationally shipped order, please contact us via email. We will process your request and provide you with return instructions as well as a label for the return of the order.</p>

            <p><strong>My order was returned to sender. What are my next steps?</strong><br>
            In the instance that the carrier was unable to locate your address or was unable to deliver after multiple attempts, your package will be returned by your local carrier at their discretion. Please note some carriers may take up to 6 weeks to return the shipment back to us. Once received our team will be notified and then your refund will be processed. Depending on your country, please allow 2 to 6 weeks for the undeliverable package to be returned for a refund.</p>

            <p><strong>How will I know the total cost of my order?</strong><br>
            Just add items to your basket and proceed to Checkout. Our system will calculate and display the order total in your preferred currency, including shipping cost from our warehouse in Europe to your selected international destination.</p>

            <p>Please remember to check your customs fees and/or taxes you may have to pay in your country.</p>

            <p>You will be liable for all duties, customs, and sales taxes based on the country requirements where the order is being sent. Upon arrival, a separate payment will be required to release your order. Sommet Noir is not responsible for payment of this duty. Please consult your local customs office for more information.</p>

            <p><strong>What are my international shipping options?</strong><br>
            The shipping method may vary depending on your ship-to country. Once you go through the international checkout process, the shipping method and shipping cost will be available for your selection.</p>

            <p><strong>How much does international shipping cost?</strong><br>
            International shipping is calculated based on multiple factors, including the destination country, desired shipping speed, number of items purchased, and total weight of the items. Duties, customs, and sales taxes are not included in the above. Please consult your local customs office for more information.</p>

            <p><strong>How much duty and taxes are charged on international orders?</strong><br>
            Duties (or Customs tariffs) are set by the destination countryâ€™s Customs and Revenues authorities. The total duties are calculated based on a combination of factors, including the country of origin in terms of where the goods were manufactured and the classification of that merchandise as defined by a harmonized system adopted by countries. International taxes (such as Value Added Tax, or VAT) are set by the destination country.</p>

            <p>Sommet Noir is not responsible for payment of this duty. Please contact your local customs office for more information.</p>

            <p><strong>How can I track my international order?</strong><br>
            You can track the progress of your international order with the link provided to you via email upon your purchase. </p>

            <p>Most items arrive 11 to 24 business days after receipt of your order depending on your Ship To address. Shipping windows are estimates and delivery dates cannot be guaranteed. </p>

            <p>Occasionally, a single order needs to be sent in two or more shipments. Shipping charges apply only to the first package shipped. There are no additional shipping charges for subsequent shipments for the same order.</p>

            <p><strong>Who should I contact if I have questions related to my international order after I checkout?</strong><br>
            Please contact our customer service team by clicking <a href="contact.html">here</a>, and we will gladly assist you with any questions relating to your international order.</p>

            <p><strong>Can I purchase or redeem international gift cards?</strong><br>
